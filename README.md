# Looking for a New Maintainer

This project is currently looking for a new maintainer. Due to limited time and shifting priorities, I’m no longer able to actively maintain it.

If you’re interested in contributing, improving, or taking over the project, please open an issue or reach out directly. I’m happy to provide guidance and help with the transition.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed so far!
